# Business_Solution_Final_Capstone_Bike_Sharing
My Final Capstone for Thinkful's Data Science Course -  predicting the rebalancing needs of a Bike Sharing Company.

Using trip data released by Citi Bike in New York, NY, we implement timeseries forecasting and regression analysis 
to predict the daily change in bike count during May 2019 for three of Citi Bike's stations.

We show how the results can be implimented to form an end-to-end business solution for the company Citi Biki.
